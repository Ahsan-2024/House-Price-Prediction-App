# House-Price-Prediction-App
This is a basic machine learning project that predicts the estimated price of a house based on user input. The app is built using Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit for a simple web interface.

**🔍 Features:**
1.User inputs: area (sq ft), bedrooms, bathrooms, and location
2.Predicts house price using a trained linear regression model
3.Clean, interactive interface built with Streamlit
4.Includes data preprocessing, model training, and deployment steps

**🛠 Tech Stack:**
1.Python
2.Pandas & NumPy
3.Scikit-learn
4.Streamlit

**📁 Files Included:**
1.house_data.csv – Sample dataset used to train the model
2.model_training.py – Script to train and save the model
3.model.pkl – Saved machine learning model
4.app.py – Streamlit web app for user interaction

**🚀 How to Run:**
